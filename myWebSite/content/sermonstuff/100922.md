### Kingdom Living Part 7: Listening to Jesus

>_**Anger**_  
>_21 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. 23 So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 25 Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. 26 Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny. (Matthew 5:21-26)_

Repeated: "You have heard that it was said... But I say to you..."

**Hostility to Reconciliation**

It is not about every anger; only 'sinful' anger\
Premise: urgently pursue Reconciliation ([Genesis 9:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+9%3A6&version=ESV), [Proverbs 12:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+12%3A18&version=ESV), [Proverbs 25:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+25%3A28&version=ESV), [Proverbs 29:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+29%3A11&version=ESV))

Anger makes prioritize yourself, and use it to achieve what you want.\
Would you invite hurricane inside your house? That hurricane is you.\
Ed Welch said, **_Anger looks like Satan... and it summons him._**\
Check your heart. There is a war inside.

Reconciliation **is** your worship (vs.23-24). Do not make excuses, go!\
Our arrogance can blind us. It is not about winning; it is loving.\
**_Reconciliation looks like Jesus, and it honors him._** ([Romans 5:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A10&version=ESV))

Reconciliation is simple but supernatural.\
Do not make your fear and embarrassment hold you back.

Is there someone you need to reconcile with? Just say three things:
* I am sorry.
* What I did was wrong.
* Will you forgive me?

Sense the urgency that we have.
