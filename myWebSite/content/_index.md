I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/). My research interest lies in cryptography and relevant theoretical problems, especially in graph-theoretical aspects. In particular, I am drawn to password hashing using data-independent memory-hard functions and its applications, towards achieving post-quantum security. I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki/) since Spring 2019. Prior to joining Purdue, I completed my M.Sc in the Department of [Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/board/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) and B.Sc at [POSTECH](https://math.postech.ac.kr/main-english/).
