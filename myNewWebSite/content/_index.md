I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/), hosted by Prof. [Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki). My research interest lies in cryptography and relevant theoretical problems. In particular, I have been fascinated by exploring the intersection of graph theory and cryptography, focusing on the classical and post-quantum security analysis of Memory-Hard Functions and Proofs of Sequential Work. I am also drawn to analyzing preprocessing security of cryptographic primitives in multiple idealized models, including short Schnorr signatures and Key Encapsulation Mechanisms. 

I recently received my Ph.D. in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/), and was honored to be advised by Prof. [Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki). Prior to joining Purdue, I completed my M.Sc in the Department of [Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/board) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) and B.Sc at [POSTECH](https://math.postech.ac.kr/main-english/).
