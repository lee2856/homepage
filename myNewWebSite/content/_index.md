I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), under the mentorship of Prof. [Douglas Stebila](https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/) and Prof. [David Jao](https://djao.math.uwaterloo.ca/). My research interest lies at the intersection of mathematics and cryptography. I am particularly interested in lattice-based and isogeny-based cryptography, both for their deep connections to algebraic and number-theoretic structures and for their significance in the development of post-quantum cryptography.

Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/) for a year, hosted by Prof. [Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki). I received my Ph.D. in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/), and was honored to be advised by Prof. [Jeremiah Blocki](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jblocki).
